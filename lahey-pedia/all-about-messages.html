      <h2>Types of Messages</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>SMS (Short Message Service) - A text message of up to 160 characters without an attached file.</li>
        <li>MMS (Multimedia Message Service) – A text message over 160 characters OR any text message including pictures, video, emoji, website link, etc.</li>
        <li>iMessages (special for smug iPhone users)
            <ul>
              <li>iMessages have the built-in technology of both SMS and MMS, and allow for even more functionality when sent between Apple devices.</li>
              <li>iMessage is faster than SMS or MMS but can only be sent from an Apple device to another Apple device(s)</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h2>What was the Lahey delimma?</h2>
      <p>To start, not all of you have an iPhone! Lol. That forces our messages with pictures, video, emoji, website link, etc. as MMS.</p>
      <p>More to know about MMS => it requires either cellular data OR to go through Wi-Fi calling.</p>
      <p>Wi-Fi Calling (aka Voice over Wi-Fi or VoWiFi) is a built-in feature on most of our current smartphones. Wi-Fi Calling lets you make and receive voice calls, texts and video calls over a Wi-Fi network instead of using a cellular network. Most carriers support Wi-Fi Calling.</p>
      <p>Now to the nitty gritty ugly harder to figure out stuff…</p>
      <ul>
        <li>WiFi calling only kicks in if your cellular signal is below a certain threshold. So we had a good enough cellular signal for our messages to bypass WiFi calling but NOT a good enough signal to send the messages quickly, resulting in a timeout.” Ultimately, the MMS would timeout and we would get the ‘Message Failed to Send’ message. In addition, the ‘Not Delivered’ would appear under the message we tried to send.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>There are two ways to fix this problem</p>
      <ol>
        <li>The super annoying solution that we dealt with for a long time => Turn off cellular data before you send any MMS message. This forces your phone to use WiFi calling since the cellular signal is not there.</li>
        <li>Buy an LTE extender (the long-term super less annoying fix). We have Verizon so we got the Verizon LTE Network Extender. An LTE extender is like having your own mini cell tower for your home or office. Weak signals from a nearby cell tower are amplified and rebroadcast. We went from 1-2 bars to 4 bars.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>For the longest time I did not understand why sometimes we would be in gif jail and then other times not. I just turned off cellular data so it would force the message over Wifi calling. I didn’t even realize what WiFi calling was at the time. I just knew we had a weak signal and this would force it over ‘WiFi’. But that is a shitty long term solution having to turn cellular data off and back on any time you want to send a freaking gif, pic, emoji, etc. Moreover, I didn’t know there was such a thing as an LTE extender and why you might want one.</p>
      <q>So we had a good enough cellular signal for our messages to bypass WiFi calling but NOT a good enough signal to send the messages quickly, resulting in a timeout.</q>
      <div class="arrow"></div>
      <p>THIS was the perfect storm to make everything so hard to figure out for us. Sometimes the signal might be WEAK enough to engage WiFi calling and Wah-Lah it goes through. However, MOST (90-95%) of the time it was the above scenario and we got the ‘Message Failed to Send’ message.</p>
      <p>So if you fall into this nasty scenario at your home, suck it up and buy an LTE extender! Break out of gif jail forever! It is GREAT!</p>
